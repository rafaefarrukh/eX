The course will also look at local and international law enforcement agencies countering the threat of transnational criminal organizations.",,
CRIM,CRIM 460,Comparative Criminal Justice Systems,3,"In this course the students will develop a theory based comparative understanding of the criminal justice organizations and processes. The main purpose of this course is to apply this knowledge in the context of Pakistan to better understand the Pakistani criminal justice system. The comparative approach is used to help students develop a) a theoretical foundation for understanding how the criminal justice systems operate and b) a knowledge base that would allow them to critically analyze and compare the different criminal justice systems. In the local context this approach is used as a proxy due to the lack of empirical literature on the Pakistani criminal justice system. However, the focus of this course will be on specific issues that are inherent to a varying degree in all systems rather than the structural differences in the various criminal justice systems and models. It will be maintained throughout this course that the nature and extent of these issues are not determined by the type of the criminal justice model implemented within a system but by an amalgamated effect actuated by various individual level, group level, organizational and contextual forces. Special emphasis will be placed on the role of line level or street level bureaucrats (SLBs) in the actual administration of justice, who as representatives of the criminal justice organizations i.e. the law enforcement, the judicial and the correctional organizations, come in daily contact with the public and implement criminal justice policies. Empowered with administrative discretion and working within the constraints of the law, the local cultural, social and political context, and organizational structures these SLBs perform their overall function of delivering justice, while trying to negotiate a balance between the demands of the public, the goals of the organization, the demands of the middle and upper-level criminal justice management, and their personal goals, dilemmas and concerns. On the other hand, during their day-to-day contact with the public, these SLBs symbolize the institutions that they represent and their behavior and decision structure, define and redefine justice administration within a jurisdiction. Thus, after acquiring a structure-based macro level understanding of criminal justice administration, during the course of this quarter, students will learn to look within structural frameworks and observe the malleable realities of justice administration. Furthermore, the students will also apply this knowledge to critically examine the Pakistani criminal justice system.",,
CRIM,CRIM 463,Radicalization and De-radicalization,3,"The course will introduce students to the topic of radicalization and its importance in contemporary social science research. The students will analyze exploratory research on various radical groups throughout the world and the theories of radicalization generated from such research. In the aftermath of 9/11 and the ensuing Global War on Terrorism a plethora of exploratory research has been conducted on individuals and groups that are labeled as ‘terrorist’ and ‘extremist’. An emergent theme within such research is the analysis of the process of radicalization. Radicalization is generally defined as a “process through which individuals and groups internalize extremist values or goals of a radical organization and cognitively accept the use of violence in pursuance of such values or goals as justified”. Scholars in the fields of criminal justice, sociology, political science and economics etc. have presented various theories that explain the process through which new and existing members of radical organizations internalize the organizational ideology and immerse themselves into the organizational culture to an extent that the goals of the organizations are cognitively perceived as personal goals and the enemies of the organizations are perceived as personal enemies. In this course the extant empirical literature on the process of radicalization and in turn the process of de-radicalization will be analyzed and critiqued.",,

This understanding is a prerequisite for making the forecasts about future population size and structure which should underpin healthcare planning. The purpose of this course will be to extend the students’ knowledge of how demographic factors impact basic health issues, of social and economic changes affecting and resulting from health events, and the utility of demographic methodological applications for understanding and managing health related events and outcomes. The effects of demographic events such as aging, childbearing, changing family structures, racial/ethnic differentials, migration, urbanization, poverty, and mortality etc. on public health issues such as health expenditures, health outcomes, prevention and reduction of diseases and disorders, and improving health care will be explored. The course through the use of rigorous research readings will also attempt to introduce students to the role of applied demography in informing and supporting public health issues.",,

SOCL,SOCL 363,Linguistic Anthropology,3,"Linguistic Anthropologists see ‘language’ as a cultural resource and ‘speaking’ as a cultural practice. Language is, therefore, both a mode of thinking and a means of practice. According to Alessandro Duranti, language is active. It is a form of action that presupposes and at the same time brings about ways of being in the world, including what isn't said. This course looks at some common ways that language is socially situated and culturally mediated. We will begin with a review of some tools used by linguists, create a baseline of what is meant by ‘cultural mediation’, and then explore a selection of writings and case studies produced by Linguistic Anthropologists. Our focus is speech communities distinguished by focal activity, as in the case of Sign Language and Hip Hop, and by social practices linked to race, social class, and gender.",SOCL 100 and SOCL 223.,
SOCL,SOCL 370,Visual Anthropology: South Asia,3,"The well-known anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, who in 1935-39 took more than 3,000 photographs during his teaching years at Sao Paulo University (Brazil), is credited with marginalizing photography in anthropology. As David Sapir explains, he devalued visual images for their imaginary dimension and their subjectivity (Sapir 1994, p. 875). Levi- Strauss privileged writing, which is no less an image construed as thought in scripted form, over other visual representations to support his theory of structural relationship. The argument is complex but our class will consider one particular issue for still photography. • Is there a different process of reading/comprehending visuals than there is in reading/comprehending written text? • Viewed in another way: Does photography entail different interpretive skills than written materials? • In exploring this prompt, consider how “Culture” mediates visualization",SOCL 100 and SOCL 223,
